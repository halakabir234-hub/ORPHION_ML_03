Introduction

This project is completed as Task-03 of the ORPHION Internship Program.
The objective of this task is to implement a statistical text generator using Markov Chains, a foundational concept in Generative AI.

Unlike neural network–based language models, Markov Chains generate text by learning probability-based word transitions from a source corpus. The model predicts the next word based solely on previously observed words, producing pseudo-random sentences that statistically mimic the original text.

This task focuses on understanding N-grams, probability, and sequential text modeling, which form the conceptual basis of modern language models.

Understanding Markov Chains for Text Generation

A Markov Chain is a probabilistic model that predicts the next state based only on the current state. In the context of text generation:

Each word represents a state

The next word is chosen based on learned probabilities

The model does not “understand” meaning, only patterns

For example, if the word “artificial” is frequently followed by “intelligence” in the training data, the probability of generating “intelligence” after “artificial” becomes high.

This task implements a bigram Markov model, where each word predicts the next word based on frequency.

Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

Python

Probability & N-grams

Regular Expressions (re)

Random Sampling

Google Colab

No external machine learning or NLP libraries are used, ensuring a strong focus on core algorithmic understanding.

Environment Setup

The project was developed and executed in Google Colab, requiring no additional installations.

The required libraries are imported as follows:

import random
import re


Since only Python’s built-in libraries are used, the setup remains lightweight and portable.

Running the Project (Colab & .py Script)

The project was initially developed and executed in Google Colab.

After successful execution, the notebook was downloaded as a .py file to enable execution outside the notebook environment.

To run using the .py file:

Ensure Python is installed

Open a terminal in the project directory

Run the script using:

python task_03_markov_chain_text_generator.py


This allows the project to be reused both in Colab and as a standalone Python script, fulfilling internship submission requirements.

Text Preprocessing

Before building the Markov Chain, the input text is cleaned and prepared.

The preprocessing steps include:

Converting text to lowercase

Removing punctuation and special characters

Splitting the text into individual words

text = text.lower()
text = re.sub(r'[^a-z\s]', '', text)
words = text.split()


This ensures consistent word formatting and improves the accuracy of word transition probabilities.

Building the Markov Chain Model

The Markov Chain is implemented using a Python dictionary, where:

Keys represent the current word

Values store a list of possible next words

markov_chain = {}

for i in range(len(words) - 1):
    current_word = words[i]
    next_word = words[i + 1]

    if current_word not in markov_chain:
        markov_chain[current_word] = []

    markov_chain[current_word].append(next_word)


This structure allows the model to learn frequency-based transitions, which directly translate into probabilistic behavior during text generation.

Text Generation Logic

The text generation process starts from a given word and repeatedly selects the next word based on learned probabilities.

def generate_text(chain, start_word, length=20):
    current_word = start_word
    result = [current_word]

    for _ in range(length - 1):
        if current_word not in chain:
            break
        current_word = random.choice(chain[current_word])
        result.append(current_word)

    return " ".join(result)


The random.choice() function ensures pseudo-random selection while respecting observed word frequencies.

Output Generation

Once the model is trained, text is generated by specifying a starting word and desired length.

output = generate_text(markov_chain, start_word="artificial", length=25)
print(output)


The generated output mimics the structure and style of the training text while remaining probabilistic and non-deterministic.

Key Learnings

Through this task, the following concepts were explored:

Markov Chains and state-based probability

N-gram language modeling

Text preprocessing techniques

Statistical text generation

Limitations of non-neural language models

This task strengthened foundational understanding required for advanced Generative AI models.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Markov Chains can be used to generate pseudo-random text using probability-based word transitions. Although simple compared to deep learning language models, this approach represents the core logic behind modern text generation systems.

By implementing the model from scratch using Python, this task highlights the importance of understanding fundamental algorithms before progressing to complex neural architectures.
